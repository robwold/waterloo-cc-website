        Waterloo Chess club provides a welcoming place for all to meet and play chess. 
        Although we're currently based in Crosby village, our members hail from across the North West.
        We've welcomed new members with Chess.com ratings below 1000, and our ranks have previously boasted an International Master,
        so whatever your previous experience you'll find someone to give you a game here. We play competitively under classical time conditions in competitions run by the 
        <a href="https://ecflms.org.uk/lms/node/89486/home">Merseyside Chess Association</a>, but people looking for a casual rapid game can usually find one.
