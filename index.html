        Waterloo Chess club provides a welcoming place for all to meet and play chess. 
        Although we're currently based in Crosby village, our members hail from across the North West.
        We've welcomed new members with Chess.com ratings in the hundreds, and our ranks have previously boasted an International Master,
        so whatever your previous experience you'll find someone to give you a game here.
